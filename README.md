# KGax

Google API extensions for Kotlin.

KGax is a small set of utility libraries for interacting with generated [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) Java stubs in Kotlin.  
It may be used directly to make interacting with the gRPC stubs a little easier in Kotlin, or it can be combined with 
a code generator to produce higher-level client libraries leveraging gRPC. 

KGax currently includes:

  1. **kgax-core**: Common dependencies for the other modules below.
  1. **kgax-grpc**: Utilities for using gRPC Java stubs in Kotlin.

## Usage

TODO: Put a basic example here...

For now, refer to the examples in the `kotlin-client-examples` directory.
